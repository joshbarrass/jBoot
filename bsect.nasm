        ;; top of the stack. (SS << 4) + SP is the physical location
        ;; of the end top of the stack.
        ;; -----------------------------------------------------------
        ;; When something is placed on the stack, SP is decreased. In
        ;; that way, the initial choice of SP decides how large the
        ;; stack is (though SP can underflow from 0 to 0xfffe, so a
        ;; stack overflow will launch SP somewhere else), while the
        ;; choice of SS defines which section of RAM the stack uses.
        ;; -----------------------------------------------------------
        ;; If we set SS to 0x0050, this will put the lowest possible
        ;; stack position (SP = 0) at 0x0500. When the stack is empty,
        ;; we want the the stack pointer to be at 0x7C00 (since adding
        ;; something to the stack pushes SP back, then adds it). So we
        ;; initially want SP to be 0x7700. This gives a little under
        ;; 30KiB of stack space.
        ;; -----------------------------------------------------------
        ;; Setting SS guarantees you one instruction with no
        ;; interrupts. Use this to safely set up the stack without the
        ;; risk of an interrupt clobbering something.
