    ; Need to set up some stack space somewhere safe

    ; ----------------------------------------------
    ; SS:SP defines the position of the stack.
    ; SP points to the top of the stack.
    ; (SS << 4) + SP is the physical location of the
    ; end top of the stack.
    ; ----------------------------------------------
    ; When something is placed on the stack, SP is
    ; decreased. In that way, the initial choice of
    ; SP decides how large the stack is (though SP
    ; can underflow from 0 to 0xfffe, so a stack
    ; overflow will launch SP somewhere else), while
    ; the choice of SS defines which section of RAM
    ; the stack uses.
    ; ----------------------------------------------
    ; If we set SS to 0x0050, this will put the
    ; lowest possible stack position (SP = 0) at
    ; 0x0500. When the stack is empty, we want the
    ; the stack pointer to be at 0x7C00 (since adding
    ; something to the stack pushes SP back, then
    ; adds it). So we initially want SP to be 0x7700.
    ; This gives a little under 30KiB of stack space.
    ; ----------------------------------------------
    ; Setting SS guarantees you one instruction with
    ; no interrupts. Use this to safely set up the
    ; stack without the risk of an interrupt
    ; clobbering something.

    ; than having to calculate where to find some
    ; data.
